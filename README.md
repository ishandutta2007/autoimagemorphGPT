# Automatic Image Morphing

### Version 1.0.0
### This is a Python command line application.

## This is adapted from Python Image Morpher (PIM) by David Dowd. https://github.com/ddowd97/Morphing and then automated by András Jankovics https://github.com/jankovicsandras/autoimagemorph

David's Python Image Morpher (PIM) is a great tool with a nice GUI. You should use it when you want to select the morph-points manually. This leads to much better results, at the expense of manual work.
```autoimagemorph.py``` selects the morph-points automatically using OpenCV ```cv2.goodFeaturesToTrack()``` . 
András Jankovics's automation is great but you would still have to serach internet and download images.
We want to automate end just by giving a prompt

## Additional features:
- automatic triangle points selection using ```cv2.goodFeaturesToTrack()```
- No GUI, single file command line program
- batch processing: transition between many images, not just 2
- optional subpixel processing to fix image artifacts
- automatic image dimensions safety (the dimensions of the first image defines the output)

## Warning
Be careful when using the required ```-outprefix``` parameter.  The program overwrites ```<outprefix><sequencenumber>.png``` files without warning. Example: ```... -outprefix f ...``` can overwrite ```f1.png```, ```f2.png``` ... Backup your png files before running the program and avoid name conflicts.

## Examples
Help:

```python autoimagemorph.py -h```

----
This will create and save ```f1.png```, ```f2.png```, ... ```f29.png```, then ```f31.png```, ```f32.png```, ... ```f59.png``` creating a continuous image sequence between the keyframes. The keyframes ```f0.png```, ```f30.png``` and ```f60.png``` will not be modified (overwritten), but only if the framerate matches their filename.

```python autoimagemorph.py -inframes "['f0.png','f30.png','f60.png']" -outprefix f -framerate 30```

----
This is how the logo ```f.gif``` was created:

1. Got some [van Gogh self portraits from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh) , converted and renamed them to keyframes ```f0.png```, ```f30.png```, ...

2. Ran this and took a nap. :)  The process took more than an hour.

```python autoimagemorph.py -inframes "['f0.png','f30.png','f60.png','f90.png','f120.png','f150.png','f0.png']" -outprefix f -framerate 30 -subpixel 4```

or

```python tests/test_autoimagemorphGPT.py  -inframes "['f0.png','f30.png','f60.png','f90.png','f120.png','f150.png','f0.png']" -outprefix f -framerate 30 -subpixel 4```

3. FFmpeg postprocessing:

```ffmpeg -framerate 15 -i f%d.png f.gif```

## Install dependencies:
```pip install scipy numpy matplotlib opencv-python```

## Recommended postprocessing:
Install FFmpeg:  https://ffmpeg.org/

Then, from command line:

```ffmpeg -framerate 15 -i frame%d.png output.avi```

```ffmpeg -framerate 15 -i frame%d.png output.gif```

## TODO:
- testing, error checks, sanity checks
- speed optimization in interpolatePoints()
- RGBA support, currently it's only RGB
- tuning the parameters of cv2.goodFeaturesToTrack() in autofeaturepoints() / giving user control
- built-in video output with cv2 ?
- image scaling uses cv2.INTER_CUBIC ; tuning / giving user control ?
- LinAlgError sometimes? Image dimensions should be even numbers?
